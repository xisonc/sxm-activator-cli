# Currently Broken - Do Not Use

Looks like SXM patched this method.

I will update this repo if I ever find a work around.

Thank you all. Remember, sharing is caring.

# Info

SXM Activator CLI tool

Quick and dirty PHP CLI script to activate satellite radios on a trial account.

Inspired by https://github.com/parker-stephens/siriusxm-activator

# How to use

This requires knowledge of how to use the command line interface, preferably on Linux or MacOS

Simply download the sxm-activator-cli script, and run it via your terminal:

```console
$ ./sxm-activator-cli MYRADIOID
```

or you will be prompted for your radio id if you don't provide one on execution:

```console
$ ./sxm-activator-cli
Enter Radio ID: MYRADIOID
```

# Requirements

Requires a relatively modern version of PHP, and the PHP CURL extension.
